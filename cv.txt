* About me
I have been an IT professional for 9 years during which time I have mostly worked on server-side application deployments, infrastructure maintenance, performance measurements and automating boring things. I have used Linux since I was 14 years old.
My strength is my ability to communicate precisely; interacting with people comes naturally to me and I like to be around (ESTP personality type).
At work, I admire command-line interfaces and open-source software.
Emacs is my friend. I prefer technical literature, hands-on experiences, and learning new things.

My plan for the nearest future is to get into Go programming and into working with sound professionally.

Always p☺sitive.
